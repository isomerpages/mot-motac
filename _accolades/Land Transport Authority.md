        <b>TOPSIS Award – Special Commendation </b>
      </p>
      <p> TOPSIS (Threat-Oriented Person Screening Integrated System) is a security enhancement programme that was first implemented at the border checkpoints to enhance aviation and border security. TOPSIS acts as an additional layer of security which can enhance the organisation’s ability to detect and deter adversaries. </p>
      <p> To recognise an organisation for implementing TOPSIS, different tiered TOPSIS Award will be accorded. LTA received a special tier of TOPSIS Award (Special Commendation Award) in 2022. This was specially created as LTA supported the TOPSIS Programme strongly, by regulating and sustaining the programme with the 4 Public Transport Operators. </p>
