             <u>Our Big Idea: #CloserToEverything </u>
           </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Beyond just creating hype to celebrate this milestone, we also leveraged TEL2 to reiterate our commitment to enhancing connectivity, building for the community, and boosting our overall rail network resilience for all Singaporeans. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Hence, our central theme of having TEL2 stations bringing us “#CloserToEverything” exemplifies the direct benefits of TEL2. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Through our campaign efforts, our audiences gained a deeper appreciation of the connectivity TEL2 brings. For our creative execution, we adopted a two-phased approach to: </p>
           <ul>
             <li> Excite the public – piquing interest and building top-of-mind awareness </li>
             <li> Engage the public – connecting with the public through exclusive and interactive content </li>
           </ul>
           <p class="mb-2"> During each phase, we conceptualised and deployed a myriad of creative publicity tactics to bring to life our campaign messages. </p>

             <u>Phase 1: Excite – piquing interest and building top-of-mind awareness </u>
           </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> We built momentum towards the TEL2 virtual OH with an Instagram Photographer Face-off Challenge, and created teaser contests and mini games for our audience to familiarise themselves with TEL2. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Using the native poll function of Instagram Stories, we encouraged our audiences to vote for their favourite images of each station and the winning photo of the day would be posted on our feed. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Such an approach, along with how we made the best use of native social media features within the platform, allowed us to creatively harness the photography skills and popularity of these photographers to extend the reach our TEL2 station photos and build up even more hype as we near the TEL2 virtual OH week. </p>

             <u>Phase 2: Engage – connecting with our audience through exclusive and interactive content </u>
           </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Launching the TEL2 virtual OH with a bang, we developed and published a three-part web series to give public a first look of the stations and their surroundings. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Presented in a refreshing hosting style, the videos showcased various aspects of our TEL2 stations in an engaging manner – from accounts of our engineers on the challenges of the project to features of the lifestyle amenities around the stations to bring out the message of connectivity. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> We also held our first ever Facebook Livestream sessions with SGAG to give our viewers a more in-depth introduction of our TEL2 stations and highlight the various behind-the-scenes work that went into the building of TEL2 stations. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Pushing the envelope further, we ventured into a new social media channel – TikTok – and connect deeper with youths. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> All in all, these creative tactics were not only tailored to suit the audience’s palette, but also carefully timed for release in sync with the campaign peak to drive highest number of views and achieve the most return on our investments. </p>

       <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold text-pri"> Despite this being our maiden attempt to pivot from what was typically a physical OH event into a fully virtual one, we have successfully leveraged our social media assets to amplify the campaign messages and drum up public excitement towards TEL2 opening. </p>
       <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold text-pri"> From the conceptualisation of exciting content pieces using a variety of interactive formats, to connecting with the public through two-way conversations and harnessing the native features of the respective social media platforms like IG polls and FB livestreams, these tactics have showcased our innovativeness in delivering the campaign outcomes at a cost-effective manner. </p>
