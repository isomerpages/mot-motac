           <p class="mb-2"> JPL Consultants proposed their solution of using inclinometers and smartphone to measure road surface profile and digital processing. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> LTA TRO partnered to co-develop and incorporate robotics and automated measuring , road pavement expertise and digitalised LTA acceptance process. </p>

           <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Current Operations</p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Current method of verifying whether the interim reinstatement is LTA COP compliant is using 3-meters straight edge, and a measuring tape to determine the flatness is within ± 5mm allowance tolerance with the surrounding adjacent surface (see illustration 7). However, current method of verifying: </p>
           <ol>
             <li>
               <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Laborious Method</p>
               <p class="mb-2"> Using analog readings from measurement tape lacks precision due to the thin millimetres lines and is often prone to parallax error if measurer does not lower their head down to road surface to align line of sight (see illustration 8). </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Time Consuming</p>
               <p class="mb-2"> A typical longitudinal interim reinstatement is more than 20m long, contractors would need walk back and forth to survey the whole stretch, to determine highest points of interest and manually verify if they are within the threshold requirement. This method is highly inefficient and time consuming, especially when contractors are required to rush and re-open work zones during peak hours (see illustration 3). </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Manual and Unergonomic</p>
               <p class="mb-2"> Contractors and Authority have to squat down to manually measure and lower their line-of-sight to read accurately (see previous illustration 4), this is highly manual and unergonomic for multiple measurements. </p>
             </li>
           </ol>
           <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2"> IRIS Innovation and Technology. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> By integrating an everyday smart phone, precision inclinometer sensors, accelerometers, gyrometer and motorised remote controlling. This carefully programmed and extensively trained device is able to process amplify and generate instant detailed report after measurement (see illustration 10). </p>
           <p class="mb-2">Some of the innovative features are:</p>
           <ol>
             <li>
               <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2"> Instant and Objective report </p>
               <p class="mb-2"> Smart phone and mobile application allow IRIS to generate accurate measurement report with GPS coordinates tagging and straight-to-email function. This non-editable detailed report will indicate in graphical and tabular digital readings, with colour coding on every measurement point. </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2"> Efficient and Continuous Measuring </p>
               <p class="mb-2"> Using just an intuitive remote controller to operate, the measurement margin of error is kept low even without skilled workers. The motorised IRIS is able to effortlessly measure a 20m long reinstatement automatically at 2m intervals continuously (see IRIS.mp4 and illustration 12). </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2"> Measuring Safety and Ergonomics </p>
               <p class="mb-2"> IRIS automated technology allows operators to measure from a safer and mobile position; being more aware of their surroundings with IRIS measuring automatically (see illustration 12). Unlike current process, where multiple manual measurements must be taken at a low kneeling position that generates blindspot (see previous illustration 4). This poses some danger as adjacent lanes are not closed, and frequent kneeling is poor ergonomics and risk of injury. </p>

           <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Partnership Involvement</p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Collecting clean and sufficient data is imperative to train an accurate model. LTA project team has been extensively involved in the software training of IRIS throughout the developmental stages. By searching different locations, organising lane closures and selecting different road profiles. LTA project lead facilitated more than 100 measurements to ensure sufficient data learning and also provided extensive benchmarking on the measurement data’s accuracy and repeatability (see illustration 14). </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> By allowing IRIS to have regular exposure to site survey on utility works around Singapore, this engages general public, contractors and utility agencies on the new innovation that LTA is working on. This project also fosters strong collaboration among authority and contractors as we value their ground feedback and suggestion during site surveys (see illustration 15). </p>

           <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Challenges Faced</p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Initially, motorised IRIS was only able to travel in straight road, but during one of the trial test locations there was a gradual bend interim reinstatement profile (see illustration 16). This posed a challenge for IRIS to measure continuously. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> After much brainstorming, LTA TRO robotics and pavement specialists advised on, adding a smart feature of differential wheel drive feedback (see illustration 17) which allows the pivot wheel to revolute slower than the turning wheel depending on the remote controller joystick feedback sensitivity which operator can help to correct IRIS automated movement. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> This development made IRIS more agile to navigate bends and turns, taking measurements effectively without adding more steering components and parts, which increases the cost, operating complexity and weight of the robot. </p>

     <div class="col-sm-12 py-2">
       <p class="mb-0 font-weight-bold text-pri"> IRIS provides continuous, efficient and objective measurements, compared to existing cumbersome method of measuring points manually. Contractors are now empowered to self-verify their own reinstatement workmanship and immediately send the digital report to LTA or supervisors offsite; proving compliance to LTA COP requirements and avoid any penalty. LTA can also more effectively regulate utility reinstatements island-wide and upkeep Singapore’s road quality, through the use of IRIS.. </p>
