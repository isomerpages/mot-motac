           <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Background:</p>
           <p class="mb-2"> In Singapore, our public streets also serve as utility corridor for services such as electricity, telecommunication, water and gas routes. Due to aging utility infrastructures and increase demand in utility capacities, more and more road opening works are required to renew and upgrade the existing infrastructures (see illustration 1). </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Moreover, with the ongoing rail and road major developments across Singapore (see illustration 2), utility diversions are necessary, such utility re-alignment road works may last more than a week. In order to minimise traffic disruption and downtime, LTA requires all the contractors to carry out interim restatement on the excavated areas at the end of every workday; to re-open roads for peak hour public usage as soon as possible. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Today, LTA receives a steady constant amount of roadworks applications every month by utility agencies and contractors; this inevitably leads to prevalent spread of interim reinstatements across Singapore (see illustration 3). Therefore, it is imperative for contractor’s workmanship to comply with LTA COP (Code of Practice) flat and flush requirement. This is to ensure smoother and safer journeys for the general public (drivers, riders and bus users), and minimise additional corrective works which creates unnecessary and preventable inconveniences. </p>
           <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Problem Statement:</p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Currently, there is no digitally efficient way to verify contractor’s workmanship compliance to LTA COP requirements. LTA relies on physical audit checks using a 3-meter straight edge ruler to manually measure selected point of interests (see illustration 4). This is both manpower and time intensive to regulate roadworks island wide as static lane closure is needed. Ideally, LTA wants to leverage on a digital acceptance solution for contractors to submit their measurement report and prove compliance for their works to supervisors and authority, without the need of being onsite constantly. </p>
           <p class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Objective:</p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Leveraging on innovation technology, to develop a continuous, efficient and precise measuring solution. For both LTA and contractors to objectively and efficiently measure interim reinstatements and verify workmanship compliance to LTA COP requirements. </p>

           <p class="mb-2"> IRIS disrupts current operation of LTA quality audits from lane closure measuring to slow moving measuring. This allows significant improvement in time saving and reduction in traffic disruption, an agile solution achieved from disruptive innovation on current processes. </p>
