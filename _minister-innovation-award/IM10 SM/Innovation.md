           <p class="mb-2"> We thus pivoted to a full digital engagement strategy for Graciousness Campaign 2021, with the following key innovative highlights: </p>
           <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">
             <u>Co-creation of the first-ever Thoughtful Bunch storybook with Sparkletots pre-schoolers</u>
           </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Through a grounds-up, collaborative effort to develop this storybook, we partnered kids from PCF Sparkletots to create a children storybook to convey messages pertaining to graciousness on public transport. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Titled “Max & Robbie’s Magical Train Ride”, it brought to life ideas from the children, through the hands of an illustrator in a magical way. </p>

             <u>Leveraging established and popular partners – MacDonald’s and the National Library Board – to amplify reach and distribute the storybook </u>
           </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> The digital storybook was hosted on our social media channels, and we also partnered exclusive partners – MacDonald’s and the National Library Board – to distribute the limited quantities of the physical book to ensure they reach the hands of our intended audience and avoid any wastage. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> These partners were convinced of the value we bring to their customers and partnered us for free, without any monetary tokens. </p>

             <u>Engaging young minds via an exclusive online reading session featuring SPS Baey</u>
           </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Putting the cherry on the cake was an online reading session featuring SPS Baey. The video was uploaded onto all of LTA’s, SPS Baey’s, as well as the National Library Board’s social media channels. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> It served as a useful and engaging resource for educators and parents (especially as a fun bonding activity during the year-end holiday season), which they could access anytime, anywhere. Given SPS Baey’s wide reach, we also effectively tapped on his network of followers to get more eyeballs for our storybook. </p>

             <u>Series of interactive and engaging content to sustain high interest and awareness of Graciousness messages </u>
           </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Through the creative use of native platform features (e.g. 360-degree photo on Facebook and IG filter on Instagram), we engaged netizens on each platform in the most interactive manner possible, and in ways that they are most familiar with. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> Specifically, we created and curate social media content that comprised: </p>
           <ul>
             <li> Social engagement outcomes, which includes periodic contests and the launch of a Graciousness IG filter to elicit engagement in a fun and interactive manner </li>
             <li> Regular festive/occasion-based social media posts to continue building affinity with netizens throughout the campaign </li>
           </ul>
           <p class="mb-2"> These content pieces served as important enablers to augment our overall comms strategy as we continually educate and engage our netizens via our social media channels. </p>
           <p class="mb-2"> The highly interactive nature of these digital tactics also allowed us to convey our key messages in a more palatable way to reiterate our messages in a more refreshing manner. </p>

     <div class="col-sm-12 py-2">
       <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold text-pri"> Through a digital-first strategy coupled with the use of novel digital tactics, we remained agile and managed to work around the uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 situation. </p>
       <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold text-pri"> We have also successfully augmented our overall engagement efforts through various digital means in highly cost-effective ways e.g. by partnering Sparkletots to co-create the storyline and injecting more relevance and relatability, by collaborating with MacDonald’s and the National Library Board to distribute the physical books at no cost, and tapping on SPS Baey’s influence to amplify the reach of our Graciousness messages to more people. </p>
       <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold text-pri"> Additionally, other than co-creating the storybook with the pre-schoolers, the teachers themselves also became our brand ambassadors as they continue to use the book to inculcate values of being considerate to our young commuters. </p>
