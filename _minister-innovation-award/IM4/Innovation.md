             <p> The idea was first generated through identifying the pain point in the construction methodology of the IEP, which is the repetitive cycles of assembly and disassembly of the conventional table formwork. </p>

             <p> LTA Project Team observed that the traditional way to construct the IEP was taking too much time to construct. The pain point was the traditional method is both laborious and repetitive. To overcome the challenges brought upon by the pandemic, LTA Project Team saw the opportunity of possibly using technology in place of manpower and conducted research for the latest available technology and the solutions in the market. At the same time, LTA Project Team also gathered suggestions and feedback from other project sites with similar structures. </p>
             <p> Without a suitable technology / solution available in the market, LTA Project Team put together a basic concept and initiated sessions with the Contractor and Consultants to brainstorm for a feasible solution. After rounds of discussions, the teams agreed on the prototype and developed the solution within a short span of 3 months, which is also customised for the Kim Chuan Depot Extension project. </p>

             <p> One challenge encountered during the implementation was that workmen were unfamiliar with this unconventional MTF. Being unfamiliar with equipment poses an additional safety risk. </p>
             <p> A thorough risk assessment and safety reviews and trainings were conducted so that the workmen could handle it safely and efficiently. The use of the MTF was also carried out under close supervision. </p>

             <p> A brief comparison of the two different methods (conventional and current) is summarised below. </p>
             <p class="text-decoration-underline"> Conventional Formwork Method </p>
             <ul>
               <li> Before casting the roof slab, the side walls of the IEP were casted first with formwork erected to the roof slab soffit. </li>
               <li> Highly sequential activities as the structural components are dependent on each other and the side walls need to gain adequate concrete strength before proceeding with roof slab construction. </li>
               <li> Labour intensive approach as workers need to dismantle and re-erect the same formwork at the next segment. </li>
               <li>Maximum Casting Length = 10m/cast</li>
               <li> Dismantling and re-erecting of the internal formwork is estimated to take 1 day with 10 workmen. </li>
               <li> Total cycle time for 1 IEP segment of 10m cast takes 9 days and requires 10 workmen. </li>
             </ul>
             <p class="text-decoration-underline">MTF Method (Current)</p>
             <ul>
               <li> Casting of side walls together with roof slab in a single pour for 30m/cast. </li>
               <li> Use of prefabricated formwork equipped with moving castor wheel for greater mobility and continuity of usage. The MTF replaces the function of the internal formwork in the conventional method above. </li>
               <li> Comes with a retractable propping system inside MTF to improve efficiency during assembly or dismantling of the formwork after casting. </li>
               <li> Shifting and setting up of MTF at the next designated work location requires 4 workmen and takes about to 1 hour to complete the setting up works. </li>
               <li> The remaining 6 workmen from the 10 men working team are available to carry out other works. </li>
               <li> Cycle time for 1 segment of 30m cast takes 24 days with the same 10 men working team. </li>
             </ul>
