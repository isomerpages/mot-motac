           <p> Over the past two years, we have successfully resonated with about 1,200 volunteers to sign up as a Caring Commuter Champion. This year alone, we saw a more than four-fold increase in certified champions, as 846 commuters were trained via the e-learning modules. This is a huge increase from the 228 Champions who were certified in the whole of 2021, when only virtual sessions were available to train Champions. </p>
           <p> There have also been active engagements with the Champions who joined us in the various activities to assist others on public transport, such as learning journeys with seniors and persons with disabilities to help them gain confidence in taking public transport independently, as well as collaborations with Primary and Secondary Schools to help spread Caring Messages to commuters through their Values-in-Action Day. </p>
           <p> We believed that the programme was shaped in the right way as it: </p>
           <ul>
             <li> Allows for scalability without corresponding increase in manpower; and </li>
             <li> Has been effective to promote a caring commuter culture in the public transport landscape to increasing awareness of this volunteer programme at organisation or community-level, thereby multiplying the Champions in our community. </li>
           </ul>
           <p> In addition, our beneficiaries - including seniors who joined the learning journeys/activities we organised with our partners for Champions to put their knowledge into practice - became more confident in taking public transport, and know how and where they can seek help from for their future commutes. </p>
           <p> In a survey done in July 2022 with Caring Commuter Champions, 93% of them agreed that the programme had motivated them to become more proactive in helping others during their daily commute – meeting our objective of making culture building a ground-up one as more volunteers in the community step up to become ambassadors to expand the impact within the community exponentially. </p>
           <p> Our experience in building a volunteer base from scratch, upskilling volunteers via a curated programme and ensuring continued engagement with activities in partnership with other social/welfare organisations can provide learning points for other agencies involved in culture and/or behaviour shaping, especially in sectors where concept of role modelling/volunteerism is less apparent. </p>

           <p> Quote from Dion Ang, a Republic Polytechnic student who became far more confident about how he can assist others after attending the Caring Commuter Champion training course: </p>
           <p> “I always found it very difficult to know when and how to extend help to vulnerable commuters. Usually in school, they only teach you to give up your seat, so it was the only way I know,”. </p>
           <p>Results from a survey done with CCCs in July 2022:</p>
           <p> Q: “The Caring Commuter Champion course has motivated me to become even more proactive in helping others during my commutes.” </p>
           <p>How far do you agree with the statement?</p>

           <p> Furthermore, the introduction of the e-training module not only reduces the manpower needed by LTA and SG Enable, but also automates multiple administrative processes, enabling further scale up in the subsequent phase. </p>
           <p> In total, we saved 276 manhours with the e-learning, enabling the team to focus on new initiatives and engagement with the growing pool of Champions. </p>

           <p> Inspired by the Caring Commuter Champions training programme, a team of Republic Polytechnic (RP) students collaborated with PTC to organise a ground-up activity called the Project CompassioNATION in Sep 2021. </p>
           <p> Project CompassioNATION is a simulation-based initiative to train and equip fellow RP students with the knowledge and skills to keep a look out for, and assist vulnerable commuters in their daily commuting journey. The inaugural project focused on challenges faced by our visually impaired, Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing commuters, wheelchair users and families with young children. </p>
           <p> RP student leaders who had attended the Caring Commuter Champion Workshop played the role of station masters for the different simulation activities that covered challenges faced by the above-mentioned vulnerable commuter profiles. </p>
           <p> The station masters then facilitated the interactive activities to allow trainees (fellow RP students) to empathise with the challenges of vulnerable commuters, and to understand the various ways to help them. </p>
           <p> After this 2-hour workshop, students were more equipped to demonstrate their role as a caring commuter champion when they are out in their commute and or at any public areas. PTC will scale this project for all polytechnics. </p>

           <p> Another ground-up project is the NUS CARE workshop organised by a group of Caring Commuter Champions from NUS Enablers in May 2022. </p>
           <p> The workshop sought to equip fellow NUS students with the knowledge on the challenges and needs of students with disabilities when commuting to and within the NUS Campus. </p>
           <p> The workshop included a hands-on component where students learnt practical tips in order to better assist vulnerable commuters with greater confidence not only on campus but the wider public transport network; and also a session for participants to brainstorm and present ideas to address commuting challenges and needs of students with disabilities. PTC intends to run such workshops for all universities in Singapore. </p>
