          <p> Based on PTC’s commuter engagement findings that Singaporeans are generally helpful to lend a hand to someone in need while taking public transport, the team focused on generating awareness and opportunities for practical action to grow a community of champions and spread the cause. </p>
          <p> The journey started with active marketing, spotlighting different groups of vulnerable commuters and how to help them effectively. The publicity campaign took the form of videos featuring human interest stories, as well as a “Be the Special Someone” Webinar to share knowledge. </p>

          <p class="mb-3 font-weight-light"> Webinar held in Dec 2020, where SPS Baey Yam Keng was one of the invited panellists, alongside the SG Enable CEO, Ms Ku Geok Boon, the late Caring SG Commuter Steering Committee (CCSC) Chairman Mr Richard Magnus and CCTF Chair Mr Jeremy Yap. The guest speaker (top left) was Ms Evon Lim, who helped an unwell old lady at the MRT and accompanied her till her son picked her up. </p>

        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p> With the foundational level of awareness created, the team realised the need to move beyond promotional efforts and directly involve commuters as advocates of the movement. This is necessary to address the tight resourcing within LTA, and to achieve more through ground-up initiations. </p>
          <p> The Caring Commuter Champion was formed to build a group of volunteers who would step up and assist fellow commuters in need during their daily commute. Leveraging the community’s effort optimises outcomes and offers a push-and-pull attraction for other commuters to join in the cause. </p>
          <p> To make the initiative beneficial to all, the team developed, from scratch, a Caring Commuter Champion (training) programme together with SG Enable and various Social Service Agencies, to overcome a concern of many volunteers, who cited inadequate knowledge as a key barrier to offer appropriate help to commuters with differing mobility needs (see Para 3 below for elaboration). </p>
          <p> The programme also became an anchor initiative that the Caring SG Commuter Committee, chaired by PTC Chairperson, could use to promote and spread the message of caring commuter culture. </p>
          <p> While volunteerism is not a new concept, having Champions as exemplary role models would transform the perception and culture of commuting as we see actions of care coming to life on our daily commute – which can be simple but impactful as it inspires a sustained ripple of caring acts throughout the PT network to continuously influence others positively. </p>

        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p> To make the Caring Commuter Champion programme more holistic (such as ‘soft’ skills) and realistic for our participants, PTC supported the Champions programme by incorporating various practical learning opportunities by collaborating with our Public Transport Operators and Institutes of Higher Learning. One such course was the Public Bus Inclusivity Course (PBIC). </p>
          <p> The PBIC is a practical training course where participants learn how to help their fellow commuters on public buses. Apart from taking the online Champions course, the PBIC , provides practical and realistic settings to equip participants with the knowledge and awareness of different types of mobility challenges, allow them to experience mobility challenges through practical case scenarios, teach participants to offer help to fellow commuters with greater confidence through the knowledge and skills acquired, and most importantly, build a strong sense of empathy through the sharing of experiences. </p>
          <p> Since the inaugural PBIC in Apr 2021 with Rulang Primary School, Tower Transit Singapore, together with the Caring SG Commuter Committee had organised another six PBIC sessions for commuter volunteers from NUS Enablers, NUS College of Alice and Peter Tan, Bukit Gombak EAGLES Interact Club and Lianhua Primary School, contributing close to 70 Caring Commuter Champions. </p>

          <p> A key to sustained new growth in volunteerism is to meet the evolving needs of new Champions. </p>
          <p> What started as a 2-hour virtual training session conducted by SG Enable on a fortnightly basis evolved to an e-learning programme comprising eight bite-size modules where participants would be able to sit through them at their own time and convenience. </p>
          <p>The shift toward e-learning was necessary as</p>
          <ul>
            <li> The team started noticing that a two-hour fixed schedule training could be a deterrence to many (especially working adults) who are unable to commit to the specific date and time of the sessions with the relaxation of back-to-office requirements; </li>
            <li> Not all participants are comfortable to interact through a virtual training session, causing unnecessary stress and drop-outs; and </li>
            <li> The growing awareness of the Caring Commuter Champion made the administrative coordination of training scheduling resource intensive. </li>
            <li> There is growing demand for SG Enable training resources as PTOs similarly step up their inclusivity efforts, hence the frequency of virtual training sessions would eventually be reduced. </li>

          <p> To recognise our Champions for stepping up, all participants who completed the training are certified and issued an identifier badge, which they can choose to wear during their commute. This helps those in need identify champions, if need be, and ask for help. </p>
