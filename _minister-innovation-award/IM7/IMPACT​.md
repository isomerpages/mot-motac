          <p> The inaugural batch of 18 youth ambassadors were of diverse backgrounds, across various IHLs and disciplines (e.g. maritime, seafaring, engineering, law, logistics, business). During their 2-year term, they would showcase their leadership by organising events to share about Maritime Singapore with their communities. This could be workshops, learning journeys, talks, campaigns, case competitions or even cultural immersion programs for foreign seafarers. </p>

          <p> The MYAs organised their inaugural event to engage foreign seafarers in Singapore on the ‘Day of Seafarer’ through an excursion to key iconic Singapore landmarks and to help signal to the wider shipping community the ease of crew change in Singapore under the Vaccinated Travel Framework since 1 Apr 2022. </p>
          <p> The ’Day with Seafarers’ event brought more than 50 seafarers and youths for a cultural immersion programme at Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage. Youths got to interact with seafarers to understand their passion for maritime. Non-maritime youths were also involved to gain awareness on the maritime industry and appreciate how the relaxation of rules for crew change has positively affect their daily lives. </p>
