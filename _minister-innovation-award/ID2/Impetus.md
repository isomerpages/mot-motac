           <p> When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, global air traffic volumes plunged as countries rushed to close their borders to curtail the spread of the virus. The global aviation industry was decimated due to the prolonged lack of demand, with many companies in the aviation sector going under or downsizing their scale of operations. Given the vital role air transport plays in supporting the flow of key economic, social and political activities between Singapore and the rest of the world, there was an urgent need to restore Singapore’s air connectivity network while safeguarding public health. </p>
           <p> The VTLs provided a safe and calibrated way for Singapore to reopen its borders to air travel amidst global uncertainty, directly contributing to CAAS’ mission of growing a safe and vibrant air hub. </p>
           <p> Based on the Ministry of Health’s data, fully vaccinated people who had contracted the COVID-19 virus were far less likely to suffer from severe symptoms compared to those who were unvaccinated. As such, requiring visitors entering Singapore via VTLs to be fully vaccinated was an effective way to restart air travel while minimising the risk of overwhelming our healthcare resources and spreading to the local community. </p>
           <p> To address public health concerns related to the launch of VTLs, a pre-specified quota was also imposed on airlines on the number of passengers which may enter Singapore on designated VTL flights. The imposed quota could be throttled depending on the COVID-19 situation in VTL countries/regions, allowing Singapore to reopen in a measured and step-by-step manner. </p>
