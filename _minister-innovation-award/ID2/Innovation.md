               <p> Singapore was one of the first countries in the region to adopt this approach towards reopening and implement it successfully without compromising public health (e.g. ensuring authenticity of vaccination certificates of VTL arrivals). The close collaboration and coordination between both private and public entities for a project of this scale was also unprecedented, and uniquely demonstrates Singapore’s unity in the fight against COVID-19. CAAS worked with multiple government agencies and stakeholders from the aviation industry to conceptualise and implement the VTLs: </p>
             </li>
             <ul>
               <li> Worked with other government agencies, such as MOT and MOH to develop border control measures, ICA/STO/HPB to develop and integrate systems to manage travellers’ application and swab status, MOM/MOE/ICA to monitor travellers’ compliance with travel requirements, etc </li>
               <li> Worked with foreign governments to establish two-way VTLs for certain countries/regions (e.g. ROK) </li>
               <li> Worked with airlines, both local and foreign, to launch VTL flights and ensure that they abide by VTL protocols </li>
               <li> Worked with other aviation stakeholders such as CAG to ensure segregation of passengers from VTL and non-VTL flights to mitigate transmission risks within the airport </li>
               <li> Worked with external parties such as Affinidi to pursue and implement digitally-verifiable vaccination certificate solutions to ensure that visitors entering Singapore are fully vaccinated </li>

               <p> The project team had also adopted an agile approach to proactively respond to the constantly evolving epidemiological situation, including calling a pause to the expansion of VTL when Omicron emerged and raged across the world in late November 2021. We cut the number of VTL travellers and deferred new VTLs. We hunkered down and waited for the opportunity to resume our efforts in rebuilding Singapore’s air connectivity. During the Singapore Air Show in February 2022, after the domestic COVID-19 situation was brought under control, we announced various moves to restore air travel, including the restoration of the VTL quota, and the launch of the deferred VTLs for Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE. </p>
