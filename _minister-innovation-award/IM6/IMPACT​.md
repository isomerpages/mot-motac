          <p class="mb-2"> SG-MDH was the world’s first data hub for maritime related datasets. Since its launch in 2019, it has garnered more than 50 million API calls from more than 80 organisations, with many innovative applications created for the industry by the MarineTech companies. This underpins the importance of data and how data sharing could fuel innovation and transformation in the industry. </p>

        <div class="col-sm-8 p-2">
          <p class="mb-2"> The successful rollout of digitalPORT@SG <sup>TM</sup> phase 1 to more than 2000 companies has saved estimated 100,000 man-hours per year to the industry by simplifying reporting processes required by various public agencies for all arriving and departing ships. The reduction of administrative workloads will also allow the shipmasters to better focus on their primary responsibility of navigating the ships safely. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> Live trials for phase 2 of digitalPORT@SG <sup>TM</sup> has commenced in May 2022 with stakeholders in the container vessel sector. It will be progressively rolled out to more than 2000 companies by 1Q 2023. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> When digitalPORT@SG <sup>TM</sup> Phase 2 is fully operational, the expected shorter stay of vessels at anchorages is estimated to achieve productivity gains that would translate to anchorage space savings. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> On top of that, the carbon footprint generated by the vessels would also be reduced due to shorter port stays </p>

        <div class="col-sm-8 p-2">
          <p class="mb-2"> Under digitalOCEANS <sup>TM</sup>, trials were successfully conducted with stakeholders to exchange ship certificates to further improve the efficiency of port clearance and port state inspection processes by allowing the certificates to be exchanged seamlessly. Additionally, the first set of API specifications for ship reporting and port clearance requirements, developed with the industry partners, have been released and announced during the Smart Port Challenge 2021. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> To underpin our ambition to enhance our digital connectivity, MPA and Port of Rotterdam signed a MOU on the green and digital shipping corridor on 2nd Aug 2022. On the digital corridor of this collaboration, both MPA and Port of Rotterdam will work together and bring stakeholders across the supply chain to optimise maritime efficiency, safety, and the transparent flow of goods by creating a digital trade lane. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> The digitalOCEANS <sup>TM</sup> API specifications will play a key role in harmonising and standardising the data to be exchanged among the stakeholders across the supply chain. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 p-2">
          <p class="mb-2"> Under digitalSHIP <sup>TM</sup>, MPA hosted the inaugural IALA-MPA workshops in 2019 with participants from 31 countries on technical standards for e-Navigation services. This supports the push for ship-to-port digitalisation on Maritime Services for e-Navigation requirements, as well as to advance the communications solutions, for which pilot trials using the VHF Data Exchange System have been planned. These efforts will help to digitalise ship-shore processes, information exchange and enhance safety of navigation. Additionally, the roll-out of 5G network over our port waters by mid of 2025 was recently announced on 4 Sep 2022. </p>

        <div class="col-sm-8 p-2">
          <p class="mb-2"> Under digitalPORT (also known as IMO-MPA SWiFT project), MPA worked with the IMO to issue a call for expressions of interest from countries with a medium sized port to take part in a pilot project to establish an efficient digitalised system for electronic exchange of information in ports for ship clearance in March 2021. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> Following overwhelming response received from applicants, Port of Lobito from Angola was selected as the pilot port for this project in October 2021. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> The project will begin its pilot phase with the Port of Lobito, to be implemented by 2023, and will be scaled up to benefit more countries in the next phase. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-12 py-2">
      <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold text-pri"> The Digital Port Ecosystem programme has led to improved port efficiency and effectiveness, co-creation of innovative applications and data sharing among the public and private entities, which benefited many stakeholders in the industry. It will continue to drive and be a catalyst, in enabling the digital transformation of Maritime Singapore, to maintain Singapore’s competitiveness as an International Maritime Centre through strengthening its global hub port’s connectivity and effectiveness, supporting maritime decarbonisation, and enabling a resilient global supply chain. </p>
