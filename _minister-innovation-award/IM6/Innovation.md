            <u>(Portal for One-stop Regulatory Transactions)</u>
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> The Singapore’s Maritime Single Window (MSW) system aims to serve as a one-stop digital portal for maritime regulatory and port services transactions. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> Phase 1 of digitalPORT@SG <sup>TM</sup> prefills and streamlines the submissions for vessel, crew immigration and port health clearances into a single process that integrates with three public agencies – MPA, ICA and NEA. Besides transforming the port clearance process, it also hosts more than 80 regulatory e-services for the maritime industry. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> Under Phase 2 of digitalPORT@SG <sup>TM</sup>, it is enhanced to a single shopfront for the industry to facilitate just-in-time allocation of port and marine services such as bunkering and repairs, by providing port stakeholders with real-time information to plan and coordinate their vessel itineraries in port and manage the booking of services with the service providers. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> In addition, an Active Anchorage Management system is developed to optimise sea space and anchorage utilisation to support JIT. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> Under this phase, digitalPORT@SG <sup>TM</sup> will also be enhanced to serve as a key node to connect digitally with other systems and platforms to facilitate interoperability. </p>

            <u>(Open/Common Exchange And Network Standardisation) </u>
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> With the requirement for national governments to introduce electronic information exchange between ships and ports under the FAL Convention, as well as the proliferation of “single window” solutions and various global and logistics supply chain platforms, there is an urgent need for system interoperability among these digital platforms to enable data exchange and integrate their services better so that the global supply chain can be more connected and resilient to enable efficient movement of essential supplies and goods </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> To achieve this, adoption of common data and technical standards, such as common API standards, is paramount. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> In July 2020, MPA led the signing of a multi-lateral digitalOCEANSTM MOU on development of common data standards and API specifications with like-minded partners and industry players. The project aims to advocate data exchange through the use of Open or Common Exchange And Network Standardisation with harmonisation of common data standards and application programming interface specifications. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> This addresses some of the barriers to data exchange, such as the financial cost of adopting a universal software platform, as well as security concerns over the hosting of sensitive data off-site or in the cloud. The digitalOCEANS™ initiative serves as the digital ‘bridge’ between shipping companies, supply chain and logistics companies, port authorities, etc. to facilitate seamless port-to-port connectivity, enabling effective information exchange and efficient transactions across the maritime transport chain. </p>

            <u> (Ship-shore Harmonisation and Interoperability Platform) </u>
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> IMO’s e-Navigation is defined as “the harmonised collection, integration, exchange, presentation and analysis of marine information on board and ashore by electronic means to enhance berth to berth navigation and related services for safety and security at sea and protection of the marine environment.” </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> The digitalSHIPTM is a platform that focuses on technical standards for data exchange of the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) e-Navigation services and data communication between ship and shore systems. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> To support the push for ship-port digitalisation, MPA recognises the criticality of the communications backbone which smart technology applications in our port waters rely on. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> MPA proactively looks at improving maritime connectivity through various means, namely 4G/5G, private LTE (pLTE) as well as both terrestrial and satellite-based VHF Data Exchange Systems (VDES). </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> On-going projects to evaluate the existing 4G seaward coverage as well as testing of 5G and terrestrial VDES networks at designated areas in our port waters for various use cases (e.g., Remote Assisted Pilotage Advisory) were conducted. </p>
          <p class="mb-2"> In the current phase, the focus will be on the operationalisation of 5G and terrestrial VDES over our Port Waters as well as satellite-VDES to provide the wider means for communications between ship and shore. </p>

          <p class="mb-2"> digitalPORT@SG <sup>TM</sup> also led to a new initiative to support the IMO’s efforts to proliferate the adoption of Maritime Single Windows (MSW) to the member states to digitalise port reporting formalities. Known as the IMO-MPA Single Window to Facilitate Trade (SWiFT) project, MPA is currently developing a generic MSW that will accelerate small and medium port’s digitalisation efforts, where the Port of Lobito (Angola) was selected as the pilot country. The generic MSW system will be delivered by Q3 2023. </p>
