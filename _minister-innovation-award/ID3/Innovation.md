           <p class="text-pri"> Public feedbacks on the long delivery timeline for <span class="font-weight-bold">bus shelters</span> were received and this was worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic where there was shortage of resources. Hence, the team embarked on an ambitious journey to <span class="font-weight-bold">halve</span> the delivery timeline. </p>

           <p class="text-pri text-decoration-underline font-weight-bold"> Innovative Aspect </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> To reduce the delivery timeline by 50%, a new innovative approach was needed. Past methods of tackling individual problems as they come, could no longer work. A holistic and complete revamp of the current processes, from planning to the final opening must be done. </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> The team then mapped out the complete cycle/value chain of the works, tackled the issue step-by-step, from agency to agency, to streamline the whole process to achieve our objectives. </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> Through this exercise, we have moved from a “fire-fighting” approach to setting up new agreements to eliminate downstream problems which typically occur. </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> We have also changed the construction method by adopting precast / prefab technology to replace the usual ‘piece-by-piece’ assembly of structural members on site. All the structural members were prefabricated and assembled off-site, before delivering down to the site for final installation. In this way, the “down time” on the actual site is better managed and the optics are better. </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> As the works are mostly done in a more controlled environment (e.g. yards, factories, etc.), issues on space constraints and inclement weather were greatly mitigated. Furthermore, the workplace is safer/conducive for the workers and there is better quality control. </p>

           <p class="text-pri text-decoration-underline font-weight-bold"> What were the difficulties encountered? </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> As we embarked on this journey, we faced the problems with the contractor who was: </p>
           <ol class="text-pri" type="a">
             <li>
               <p> more cost-sensitive and are hesitant to try out new methods of construction as they are more familiar and used to the usual conventional and established construction methods; </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p> preferred conventional methods / practices are usually labour-intensive and lower in productivity </p>
             </li>
           </ol>
           <p class="text-pri"> Through engagement with the contractor, we found that there were issues faced with agencies such as: </p>
           <ol class="text-pri" type="a">
             <li>
               <p> Tedious and iterative processes in getting agencies’ clearances for design and for work commencement </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p> On the land issue, administrative process like serving the Street Works Act to work on non-MOT land can take a long time to process </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p> Long time to get approval from utility agencies (Telco, SPPG, etc.) and IMDA due to the presence of underground services </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p> Long process to get clearances to open completed facilities for public use </p>
             </li>

           <p class="text-pri text-decoration-underline font-weight-bold"> What was done & who were the involving partners? </p>
           <p class="text-pri font-weight-bold"> Collaboration Process with Partners shown in Steps 1A to 1B: </p>
           <p class="text-pri">
             <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 1A</span> – To achieve the 50% reduction in delivery timeline, we cannot use the same construction method with the same bus stop design. Although prefabrication / Precast technology is commonly used in the industry for bigger complex structures (e.g. building works), it has never been used in simple structures like bus shelters. Hence, we identified the forward-looking contractor to collaborate with us to try out new initiatives – that is to use prefabricated elements in erecting bus shelters.
           </p>
           <p class="text-pri">
             <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 1B</span> – In the past, we only intervened when contractors voiced out their difficulties in getting clearances with the agencies. Instead of such reactive approach, we kickstarted to engage the various agencies to re-establish new SOPs to smoothen and quicken the submission and approval processes. We took the lead to tackle the potential issues before we faced them in the downstream.
           </p>
           <p class="text-pri font-weight-bold mb-0">With HDB:</p>
           <p class="text-pri"> Typically for working on other stakeholders’ land, there is a need to serve Street Works Act (SWA) before we can commence works. The engagement and serving of SWA can easily take up to 2 months to concur. Therefore, we engaged HDB and resolved this land encroachment issues with HDB for earlier site entry for commencement, through a memorandum of agreement. This has shortened the time from 2 months to 2 weeks. </p>
           <p class="text-pri font-weight-bold mb-0">With NParks & PUB:</p>
           <p class="text-pri"> As bus shelter design are usually similar, the submissions are iterative and repetitive. At times, this tedious process is further extended by editorial comments (i.e. wrong colour / annotation used, etc.). Hence, we knocked the doors of NParks & PUB and established a set of typologies with them. The current submissions to NParks and PUB consist of standardized plans and method statement submission, which has enhanced their review process and in turn, we have gotten faster clearances to proceed with the works. </p>
           <p class="text-pri font-weight-bold mb-0"> With IMDA & Utility Agencies: </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> Before any work commencement, trial trenching must be done to detect for any possible underground services which may pose constraints to the construction. Should there be any presence of underground services which will impede construction, either waiver application or protection measures will be required with the respective utility agencies. This whole process of clearing the utility agencies can take up to 3 months. Hence, we engaged IMDA and the utility agencies to streamline work processes by prioritising approvals for trial trenching works for Road and Commuter Facilities and introduce “standardised utility protection” method for faster waiver processing. This effort has shortened the process from 12 weeks to 8 weeks. </p>
           <p class="text-pri font-weight-bold mb-0">With BCA:</p>
           <p class="text-pri"> The team felt that the current TOP requirements may be too excessive, especially for simple structures such as bus shelter. So we started exploring the idea of expediting the TOP process by scaling requirements accordingly to the complexity of the infrastructure. We pushed against the norms for the usual BCA-TOP process by relooking at the application and submission process. We aim to cut down time, especially the waiting period for the TOP inspection. </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> Following which, we negotiated with the respective agencies for simplified TOP or wavier. The agencies agreed after we assured them that LTA, being the developer and the maintenance party, would take on the responsibility to ensure that bus shelters are constructed according to the approved design. </p>
           <p class="text-pri">Eventually, we managed to:</p>
           <ul class="text-pri">
             <li>
               <p>do away the TOPs with PUB and URA</p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p> gotten a faster clearance (3-day) with NEA through their lodgement scheme </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p> benefitted from NParks’ in-house streamlined processes where they had done away with TOP application for simple structures </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p> gotten BCA’s acceptance to replace TOP site inspection with “evidence-based” submission (i.e. to submit photos / videos of completed works) for simple structural works </p>
             </li>
           </ul>
           <p class="text-pri"> This simplified TOP proposal was eventually tabled at the Inter-agency Coordination Committee (IACC) Meeting to seek for endorsement. This proposal was very well-received by the members of the committee (industry players). BCA then issued a memo on this simplified TOP process for bus shelters developed by LTA on 1 Dec 2021 to formalise this process. </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> The TOP process was ultimately reduced from 8 weeks to 2 weeks. </p>
           <p class="text-pri font-weight-bold"> Upskilling Process with the Contractor shown in Steps 2A to 2D: </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> Our contractors are used to working alone and are familiar with the usual conventional working methods. Being a common denominator, RCID exerted positive influence through sharing sessions and workshops on the latest technology, thus enabling them to learn from each other. </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> The current method of erecting the bus shelter is through on-site casting of bus platform slabs and ‘piece-by-piece’ assembly of structural members. This process is labor-intensive and is also subjected to weather condition. During the pandemic where the worksites rules prevailed, it was also a must to observe SMM on site where only one trade of workers can work on site at any one time. This has prolonged the construction period and caused public inconvenience. </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> What if the assembly can be done off-site? Then all the mentioned concerns can be reduced and even eliminated. </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> Hence, we explored a plug-and-play solution and eventually decided to adopt pre-fabrication technique for better quality control & managing ‘down time’ due to lack of resources. We adopted modular design and use BIM to identify potential issues before construction. We aimed to complete the bus shelter construction works on site within 5 days. </p>
           <p class="text-pri"> As the bus shelter is being prefabricated at the yard, “downtime on site” due to bad weather conditions or lack of resources has been eliminated. Most importantly, the period of inconvenience to public will be reduced. </p>
           <p class="text-pri">
             <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 2A</span> – the involved contractor was linked up with other players who are able to support them in areas where the former is lacking (e.g. software support like BIM).
           </p>
           <p class="text-pri">
             <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 2B</span> – started doing the trials where feedbacks were gathered to continually fine-tune the process
           </p>
           <p class="text-pri">
             <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 2C</span> – shared success story and pitfalls along the way with other contractors who are doing the similar works through forums and workshops
           </p>
           <p class="text-pri">
             <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 2D</span> – identified the common skillsets that are lacking (e.g. software knowledge, programme planning, HR practices) and held curated courses to strengthen the involved contractor further
           </p>
           <p class="text-pri font-weight-bold">Setting the Standards</p>
           <p class="text-pri"> Lastly, we standardized the details of the successful initiatives and incorporated into our upcoming tender specification to extend to the industry and to ensure compliance and more VFM proposals from our contractors </p>
