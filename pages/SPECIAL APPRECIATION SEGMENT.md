  <h1>SPECIAL APPRECIATION TO MOT HQ AND STATUTORY BOARDS FOR STRIVING ON WITH INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE FUTURE IN 2022</h1>

      <p class="mb-2">The Special Appreciation Award (SAA) is given to show our appreciation to officers in the MOT Family for extraordinary efforts put in the past year. The theme for the SAA is “Striving On With Infrastructure For The Future”, both the hardware and heartware. During this year’s MOTAC, we will recognise the efforts of MOT HQ, CAAS, LTA, MPA and PTC in implementing initiatives such as T5’s relaunch, Tuas Port’s Phase 1 opening (both NDR mentions), EV charging stations, as well as the recent progress on rail lines on the home front (TEL2-3’s completion, CRL/JRL’s ground-breaking), amid the serious manpower and supply chain challenges arising from COVID-19.</p>
